# 🛠️ OmniToys

Yo! Welcome to **OmniToys**. This is my centralized personal toolbox where I'm regrouping every utility I actually need in one place.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **OmniToys is currently a Work In Progress (WIP).** I am actively building out the modules. This means the project is still incomplete, and many planned tools and features are not yet available in the laboratory.

The goal is a "privacy-first" space. No tracking, no cloud nonsense, just local tools that work fast and look premium. I'm building this to center my workflow, but I'm sharing it here for anyone else who wants a cleaner dev experience.

README will be updated soon too.
